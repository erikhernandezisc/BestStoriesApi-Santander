## üß† Assumptions & Technical Decisions

- **LazyCache** is used to cache:
  - Best story IDs (`10 minutes`)
  - Individual story details (`10 minutes`)
- Since stories are mostly immutable, caching is appropriate to reduce API load.
- Future enhancement: a `refresh=true` query parameter to force cache refresh.
- A simplified DTO is returned with only required fields.

---

## üå± Future Improvements

- Add **distributed caching (e.g. Redis)** for multi-instance deployments.
- Support `refresh` query param to invalidate cache manually.
- Add logging and metrics to monitor usage and performance.
- Include unit tests and load tests using Artillery or k6.
